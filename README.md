# My-First-App
My First Android App 

There are two screens in this app.

On the first screen are placed three buttons: 
1. Clicking on the 1st one 'Toast', you get a toast message: Hello Toast!
2. Clicking on the 2nd one 'Count', the number placed in the center of the screen gets bigger by 1 (+1)
3. Clicking on the 3rd one 'Random', you get changed to the second screen (Second Fragment) and you can 
see the random number between 0 and the number that was on the previous screen.
You can also get back to the previous screen by clicking the button 'Previous'.
